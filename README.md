Arduino Source code for Illumi high-power colored lamp

This is the code that is embedded in the lamp.

## How to use

Right now you need to define your wireless network settings in the file settings.h. Also the program is expecting an RGB led with a common ccathode on pins 9, 10 and 11. If this is not your setting, change those in settings.h.
